**`Self-Taught Programmer(wannabe programmer)`**

IÂ´m currently a "Self-Taught" programmer getting ready to study "Computer Science and engineering" at uni. In my Github, I'm gonna publish all my learning journey with some programming languages, as well as some projects so that I donÂ´t get stuck in "Tutorial Hell"ðŸ˜„. Sometimes I stream this journey on Twitch so make sure to check it out: "[xvvsb][twitch]"
